# SFP-Corpus-against-ChatGPT
The dataset here are results generated from my FYP which studied ChatGPT’s Pragmatic Competence in Interpreting Singlish Sentence-Final Particles. Click each file to download the raw excel file. 

The original corpus is taken from the NUS SMS Corpus, which can be found in https://github.com/WING-NUS/nus-sms-corpus/tree/master. All credits of the original corpus that I used for in my FYP goes to Tao Chen and Min-Yen Kan. 

If you would like to use these dataset for your research, please do me a favour and do the following:
1. Drop an email to Tao Chen at chentaokite@gmail.com to let the original corpus owner know you intend to use the corpus for your research
2. Drop a quick email to zhixuanlim24680@gmail.com or zlim118@e.ntu.edu.sg and just for my curiosity, give me a brief on what do you intend to use the data for

Thanks!
