# SFP-Corpus-against-ChatGPT
The dataset here are results generated from my FYP which studied ChatGPT’s Pragmatic Competence in Interpreting Singlish Sentence-Final Particles.

If you would like to use the dataset for your research, please do me a favour and send a quick email to zhixuanlim24680@gmail.com or zlim118@e.ntu.edu.sg and just for my curiosity, give me a brief on what do you intend to use the data for. Thanks!
